# Dusty Gas Model
Here I am trying out the Dusty Gas Model (DGM) with different equations. The equations are taken from the Zou Paper.

A model with Fick's Law is also created.

A control volume, representing the flow channel, electrode and reaction side is created. Later it should be combined with the diffusion models.
